#Synopsis

**confiture** is my personal linux configuration. The configuration is based on an i3-wm workspace on archlinux.
This way, whenever your have to make a fresh install because your old HDD crashed or whatever, you will not be afraid to have to setup everything manually in the worst scenario.

#Support

These configuration files support :

* i3
* git
* vim
* conky
* rofi
* urxvt

#About

Confiture, because I like jam.
This repository, because sharing is knowledge.

#Preview

*“La culture, c’est comme la confiture, moins on en a, plus on l’étale.”*
