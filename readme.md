# Synopsis

**confiture** is my personal linux configuration. The configuration is based on an i3-wm workspace on archlinux.
This way, whenever your have to make a fresh install because your old HDD crashed or whatever, you will not be afraid to have to setup everything manually in the worst scenario.

# Support

These configuration files support :

* i3
* git
* vim
* conky
* rofi
* urxvt

# FAQ

> Awesome vim colorscheme ! Where did you found it ?

I build it myself.

> Plugin for urxvt ?

Install `urxvt-perls` and move `.urxvt` to home dir.


# Special thanks to
